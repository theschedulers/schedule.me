## About the Project

A group scheduler app where users form teams and input availabilities and shifts on a team calendar! https://sjsu-schedule-me.herokuapp.com/

## Some answers to some questions
- If you run into any errors that will not allow you to do anything, contact us. The application is buggy and needs improvements üëç
- If you cannot edit any shifts or anything on the team, it may be a payload error. The grid is very large and data transfers may not be working properly with large amounts of data (Free version of MongoDB Cloud).
- If you want to export calendars, those are not quite done yet so üò∂
- Also try not to have multiple users edit things at the same time. It will work fine if you go one by one (sequentially), but may break if multiple users are editing the same data.

## Node Dependencies to Download

This project involves many node dependecies. I will list them here: Mongoose, Express, Concurrently, Axios, Morgan, Nodemon, React-Router-Dom, Bootstrap, Reactstrap.<br /><br />
Assuming that you already have Node.js installed and everything, there are many ways to download the dependencies necessary to get it working. <br /><br />

First way is to clone this project and in your local terminal, run `npm install`. <br /><br />

Below is the code I used to install them all. This would be the second way.<br />

`npm install mongoose express concurrently axios morgan -s`<br />
`npm install -g nodemon`<br />
`npm install react-router-dom`<br />
`npm install --save bootstrap`<br />
`npm install --save reactstrap react react-dom`

## When deploying to Heroku

Make sure that you have Heroku connected to your GitHub account. This will make the process of connecting your application much easier as deployments will be through GitHub code that you push onto your repository.

## Get your config vars ready
There are only two config vars necessary to get your web app up and running completely. One is for MongoDB Atlas connection (`MONGODB_URI`) and the other is your env var for production and development (`NODE_ENV`). For the MongoDB Atlas URI, make sure you create a MongoDB atlas account, create a cluster, and there should be a button for you to connect it to your application. Make sure you follow all the steps and you should get a funky looking link to copy into the config vars section in Heroku. The env var has two options, "development" or "production". Usually you just keep it in production.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
